### Vision:
  EduCert aims to revolutionize the way educational institutions issue certificates by leveraging blockchain technology. This project strives to make education more accessible, transparent, and secure by offering NFT-based certificates that are immutable and verifiable. In the future, we aim to expand the platform to support a wider range of educational institutions globally and provide more advanced features for better tracking and engagement.

2. **Institution Dashboard**: Build an interface for institutions to create, manage, and monitor crowdfunding campaigns.
3. **Student Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for students to access and view their NFT certificates.
4. **Smart Contracts**: Develop and deploy smart contracts for NFT minting and fund distribution using the Andromeda Protocol.
5. **Frontend Development**: Create the frontend in React to integrate with the Andromeda Protocol backend and provide a user-friendly interface.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the platform on Andromeda Protocol and test all components in a live environment.
